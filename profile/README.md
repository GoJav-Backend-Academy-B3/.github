## 🍿 The Experience 
We are using Scrum approach to collaborate. We learned using tools such as Trello for organizing our project backlog. We also learned how to collaborate in Git, how to resolve conflicts, work asynchronously, merge branches, and so on.

We have been able to complete the project successfully. Even in our spare time, we still contribute to this project.

## 🌈 The Impact
It has been a valuable experience for us to collaborate on this project. Hopefully, we can apply what we have learned in our respective companies in our future journeys.
